== Installation ==

To install the plugin, simply copy the files into a subdirectory of the WordPress plugin directory (normally wp-content/plugins). Then go to the WordPress admin panel, and in the Plugins section you should see the ReachFactor plugin. Click on "Activate" to make your plugin active.

= Account Setup =
You must either have a premium ReachFactor account or a special free version of ReachFactor through a <a href="http://www.reachfactor.com/partners/">partner</a> for this plugin to work properly. 

= Configuration =

Once the plugin is active, inside the Settings menu, there will be an option called ReachFactor. Click on it, and a form will appear allowing you to link your plugin to a ReachFactor account and to customize your widget and badge appearance. You will need to enter the email address you have registered on ReachFactor. When you save the form the plugin will connect to ReachFactor and getthe details it needs to show the widget and badge.

= Use =

To get the widget or badge to display in the template you need to use the reachfactor_badge and reachfactor_widget template tags. For example:

`<?php reachfactor_widget(); // will display a widget ?>`

`<?php reachfactor_badge(); // will display a badge ?>`

To display the ReachFactor badge or widget in the content of a post, use the reachfactor-widget and reachfactor-badge shortcodes. For example:

`[reachfactor-widget]`

`[reachfactor-badge]`
